# JetpackComposeSpotifyUI
Trying out the new Jetpack Compose Toolkit by imitating the Spotify 2018 layout. 

Note: No logic is implemented other than showing toasts. This was created purely as an UI project.
Some things are not 1:1 such as some images and icons and were manually created or pulled from the internet.
